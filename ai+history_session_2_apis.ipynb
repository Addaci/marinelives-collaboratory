        "**2. What is Colab?** Google Colab, short for \"Collaboratory,\" is an online tool from Google that lets you write and run Python code right in your web browser. It’s great for projects like data analysis, creating visualizations, and working with machine learning and artificial intelligence. One of its best features is that it gives you free access to powerful computing resources like GPUs, which are often needed for more demanding tasks. Colab is easy to use and works like a digital notebook where you can write code, add explanations, and see your results all in one place. It’s connected to Google Drive, so you can save your work and share it with others, making it perfect for teamwork and learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Getting started with Colab:** As a non-coder, getting started with Google Colab is straightforward and doesn't require any prior programming experience. Here's how you can begin:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Access Google Colab: [Visit Google Colab in your web browser](https://colab.google/). You'll need to sign in with your Google account.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Create a New Notebook: Once signed in, click on \"File\" in the top-left corner, then select \"New notebook.\" This will open a new document where you can write and run code. The default name of the document is Untitled0.ipynb, which you can easily change. When you create your own Colab notebooks, they are stored in your Google Drive account.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Explore the Interface: Familiarize yourself with the notebook interface. Each \"cell\" can contain code or text. To run a code cell, click the play button next to it or press Shift + Enter.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Learn Basic Python Concepts: Google Colab provides an [introductory notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) that covers the basics of Python programming and how to use Colab effectively. This resource is designed for beginners and is a great starting point.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Practice with Examples: Try out simple Python exercises to build your confidence. For instance, you can write a cell with the following code to print a message:\n",
